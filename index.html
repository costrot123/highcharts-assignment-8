<p class="longp">Since the beginning of the early 2000s many European countries have been dealing with an influx of migrants and refugees. This influx has been caused by various armed conflicts in Africa and the Middle East such as the Iraq War, Afghanistan conflict, and the Syrian Civil War. As the graph shows, the number of refugees each year appears to be growing with little sign of slowing down. Given that the Syrian civil war is still being fought, we can expect this number of refugees to continue increasing as people escape the war torn Middle East for peace and prosperity in Europe.

<p class="longp">Since the number of refugees in Europe has been increasing due to the armed conflicts happening in the Middle East and parts of Africa, the percent of migrants in the population of these four countries has also increased. Public attitudes toward migrants in these countries vary. For example the majority of Italians believe that migrants are burden to the country. On the other hand, the majority of Germans and French believe that they make their country stronger. This statistic perhaps can explain why Germany and France have more refugees than Italy. It is important to note the difference between a migrant and refugee. Migrants are residents or citizens of the country they are located in. Refugees are people who had to leave their country to escape conflict or persecution.
